  # == XQuery Class Definition

  # Represents a query. Please don't create an Exist::XQuery instance
  # directly, try using Exist::ExistDB#query instead. To execute the
  # query just call to the _execute_ method. If you just want to know,
  # the number of matches that the query produces, use one of the following
  # methods: _count_, _length_ or _size_.
