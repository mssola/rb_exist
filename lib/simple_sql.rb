  ##
  # == SimpleSQL Class definition
  #
  # This class provides a set of methods that makes easier
  # to imitate SQL's select, insert and update queries. As you will
  # notice, the way to work with this class is a bit different
  # from the regular XQuery class.
  class SimpleSQL < XQuery
    ##
    # Constructor.

    # The select query. It takes the following parameters to work:
    #
    #   - from: the table.
    #   - where: the condition to the select query.
    #   - TODO: to implement order by,
    #
    # Select subqueries are not allowed since I don't know exactly
    # its behavior. Let's illustrate an example. Imagine that we
    # have a table called user with name and age as its attributes.
    # A correct select query would be:
    #
    #   sql = db.simple_sql # db is our Database connection
    #   sql.select(:from => 'users', :where => 'age>20')
    #
    # Obviously, we can check the number of matches by calling the
    # instance method SimpleSQL#count.
    #
    # @return *LibXML::XML::Document* The XML tree produced by the query.
