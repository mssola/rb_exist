  ##
  # == SimpleSQL Class definition
  #
  # This class provides a set of methods that makes easier
  # to imitate SQL's select, insert and update queries. As you will
  # notice, the way to work with this class is a bit different
  # from the regular XQuery class.
  class SimpleSQL < XQuery
    ##
    # Constructor.
    #
    # @param *Exist::ExistDB* database The database connection.
    def initialize(database)
      @db, @rows = database, 0
    end

    ##
    # The select query. It takes the following parameters to work:
    #
    #   - rows: TODO
    #   - from: the table.
    #   - where: the condition to the select query.
    #   - order_by: how should the result be ordered.
    #
    # Select subqueries are not allowed since I don't know exactly
    # its behavior. Let's illustrate an example. Imagine that we
    # have a table called user with name and age as its attributes.
    # A correct select query would be:
    #
    #   sql = db.simple_sql # db is our Database connection
    #   sql.select(:from => 'users', :where => 'age>20')
    #
    # We may also want to order the result. In order to do that, we can
    # just call this method as follows:
    #
    #   sql.select(from: 'users', where: 'age>20', order_by: 'name_ascending')
    #
    # The result will be sorted by the name in ascending order. So, you just
    # have to write the row's name. You may also specify the ordering
    # algorithm by appending _ascending or _descending to the row's name.
    # However, be aware that this will only work with strings.
    #
    # Finally, we can check the number of matches by calling the
    # instance method SimpleSQL#count.
    #
    # @return *LibXML::XML::Document* The XML tree produced by the query.
